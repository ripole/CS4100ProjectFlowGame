Abstract: 
Our goal is to solve a logic puzzle using AI where the user matches pairs of same-color nodes on a grid with single continuous lines that move in an up, down, left, right direction. The objective of the game is to connect all nodes of the same color and fill the entire grid. We utilized simulated annealing as the basis for the solution search and tried different move finding strategies to create the most optimal states for the AI to find solutions to each puzzle board. In the end, we found that making moves on the most constrained paths worked well in helping us find solutions, as well as creating a good heuristic function. Our agent is not perfect, but we were able to get it to reach a state where it is able to solve every puzzle it is given with time.
